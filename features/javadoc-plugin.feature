Feature: Test Javadoc plugin
 
  Scenario: Publish javadoc
    Given a Maven
    And a job
    When I configure the job
    And I add build steps to generate javadoc
    And I add a Publish javadoc post build step with path "my-app/target/site/apidocs/"
    And I save the job
    And I build the job
    Then the build should succeed
    And the job should have "Javadoc" action
    And the javadoc should display "com.mycompany.app"
